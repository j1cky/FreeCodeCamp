### project 8 : Tower of Hanoi

"""
Learn Recursion by Solving the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle

Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated
computational problems with just a little code.

In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower
of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.
